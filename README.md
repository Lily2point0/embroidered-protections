# Embroidered Protections
## About the project
The aim of this project was to collaboratively craft digitally augmented interactive sister quilts to explore notions of ‘women’s safety’. This project was intended to digitally and physically enhance in-person collaborations in the UK and in Turkey, as well as metaphoric collaboration between the people working across the two countries.

## Repository contents
This repository hosts the technical, digital parts of the quilts. 
- The `words` folder contains a couple of versions of the algorithm that was used to determine the order of the words on each quilt (and which language they should be in).
- The `AR-prototype` folder is the bare-bones architecture to detect our cross-stitch markers with WebAR.
